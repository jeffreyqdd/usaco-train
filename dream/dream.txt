Arr distance of size #ofnodes initialized to infinity

distance[starting_node] = 0 //distance to start is zero

p_queue q that contains a pair<weight,node>
push(0, stating_node)


While q is not empty:
	pop item from queue

	if item is what we need:
		process

	//check visited
	//mark visited
	
	for child node to item:
		starting node a
		ending node b
		edge weight to b called w
		
		if distance[a] + w is less than distance[b]:
			set distance[b] to new new weight
			push the pair -weight, new node to q
