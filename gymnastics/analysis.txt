What we know:
    K practice sesssions
    N cows in each practice sesssions

What we want to know
    Number of consistent pairs

What is a consistent pair?
    cow a is consistently ranked higher than cow b

data:

3 4
4 1 2 3
4 1 3 2
4 2 1 3

approach: Bronze problem, we can brutal force this

1) read the data into a 2d array: arr[k practice sessions][N cows]

2) generate all possible combinations of cows:
    for cowA in range(1,N):
        for cowB in range(1,N):
            if(cowA != cowB)
                iterate through every practice sessions
                if cow a is conistent to cow b, increment counter

3) return the answer (counter)
